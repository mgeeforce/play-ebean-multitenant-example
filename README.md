# play-ebean-multitenant-example

This is an example service implementation for a multi-tenant system with tenant specific database.

## Implementation Details

In this example, we have a 'master' database. This database has 'Tenant' table which stores all the tenant information. Refer [Tenant.java] (https://github.com/kcthota/play-ebean-multitenant-example/blob/master/app/master/Tenant.java).

And each tenant has its own database and in our example we have 'User' table defined in these tenant databases. Refer [User.java] (https://github.com/kcthota/play-ebean-multitenant-example/blob/master/app/models/User.java).

Every HTTP call will have the tenantId value in request headers, which is used to connect to the appropriate database. Using Play's Action composition mechanism, we created TenantAwareAction which would be executed for all annotated classes or methods.

In [TenantAwareAction.java] (https://github.com/kcthota/play-ebean-multitenant-example/blob/master/app/actions/TenantAwareAction.java), we check for tenantId and configure a EbeanServer, if not already available, for that tenantId. Post execution of TenantAwareAction, the call would be delegated to appropriate controller method. 

In our example, [UserController.java] (https://github.com/kcthota/play-ebean-multitenant-example/blob/master/app/controllers/UserController.java) has getUsers method which is annotated as [TenantAware] (https://github.com/kcthota/play-ebean-multitenant-example/blob/master/app/annotations/TenantAware.java). In this method, we can get tenant specific EBeanServer object for performing the database operation.
